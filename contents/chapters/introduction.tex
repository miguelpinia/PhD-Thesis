These days, it is very common to hear about new processors that increase the number of cores in each one. Tasks like gaming, data processing, rendering animation, and video editions are becoming more natural in the day-to-day. These tasks take advantage of the new processors and their multi-core architectures. It is worth mentioning that these multi-core processors are already present in laptops, smartphones, PCs, tablets, smart TVs, multiple IoT\footnote{Internet of the Things.} devices, smartwatches, and even devices like keyboards!\footnote{My current keyboard is already a tiny computing device; it has a small screen on which small applications can be displayed and some additional controls like a knob to use such applications. Regarding the keyboard's processor specification, the provider mentioned that the processor follows a multi-core architecture without specifying which one.} No matter if we are specialized programmers like those who work in embedded systems or we are working on backend software or developing smartphone applications, it is really important to design and code algorithms that take advantage of these multi-core architectures.

However, concurrent computing is one of the most challenging topics in computer science.
