\section{\label{sec:experiment-conclussions} Conclussions of case of study 1}

In Chapter~\ref{chapter:4_work-stealing}, we studied the use of multiplicity applied to work-stealing. We can conclude, in general, that relaxed work-stealing algorithms enhanced performance in the benchmarks with lightweight tasks. In the case of graph exploration, the FIFO insert/extract policy provided better improvements. In the benchmark with heavy tasks, all algorithms performed equally.
